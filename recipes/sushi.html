        </li>
        <li>1/4 cup rice vinegar
        </li>
        <li>8 sheets nori (seaweed)
        </li>
        <li>1/2 lb sushi-grade raw fish (like tuna or salmon), thinly sliced
        </li>
        <li>1 cucumber, cut into thin strips
        </li>
        <li>1 avocado, thinly sliced
        </li>
        <li>Soy sauce, for serving
        </li>
        <li>Pickled ginger, for serving

        <li>Rinse the sushi rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Cook the rice according to the package instructions.
        </li>        
        <li>While the rice is still hot, add the rice vinegar and mix well. Allow the rice to cool to room temperature.
        </li>
        <li>Lay out the nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Spread a thin layer of sushi rice on the sheet, leaving about 1 inch clear at the top.
        </li>
        <li>Arrange the fish, cucumber, and avocado in a line down the center of the rice.
        </li>
        <li>Roll the sushi using the mat, applying some pressure to keep it tight. Wet the clear part of the nori slightly to help it stick and seal the roll.
        </li>
        <li>Use a sharp knife to cut the sushi roll into bite-sized pieces.
        </li>
        <li>Serve with soy sauce, pickled ginger, and wasabi on the side. Enjoy your homemade sushi!
