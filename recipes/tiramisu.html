    <ul>
    <li>6 egg yolks</li>
    <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cups heavy cream</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
    <li>8 ounces mascarpone cheese</li>
    <li>1 cup strong brewed coffee, room temperature</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons rum (optional)</li>
    <li>2 packages ladyfinger cookies</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
       <li>In a medium saucepan, whisk together egg yolks and sugar until well blended. Add in milk and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until it boils. Boil gently for 1 minute, then remove from heat and allow to cool slightly.</li> 
       <li>Whip heavy cream with vanilla until stiff peaks form. Beat in mascarpone until combined.</li>
       <li>Dip each ladyfinger into the coffee (and rum if using), and layer in the bottom of a serving dish. Spread half of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers. Repeat with remaining cookies and mascarpone.
        <li>Dust the top layer with the cocoa powder using a sieve.</li>
        <li>Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, up to 8 hours before serving. This allows the flavors to meld together.</li>
